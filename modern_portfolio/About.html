  <strong >HOBBIES</strong>
  <pre style="padding: 0%; top: 10%;">Hi, I’m Joshua passionate and wellrounded individual who enjoys 
    staying active and constantly learning. 
    Football is not just a game for me; it’s a way to build teamwork, 
    sharpen strategy, and stay energized. 
    Whether I'm on the field playing with friends or
    following international matches, football keeps me motivated and connected.

    When I’m not playing, you’ll probably 
    find me with a book in hand.
     I love reading both fiction and non-fiction,
      as it opens my mind to new ideas, cultures, and perspectives. 
     It’s a habit that helps me grow intellectually and stay curious.
    
    I also make time for <b><u>jogging </u></b>, 
    which is my favorite way to relax and stay fit.
     Early morning runs help me clear my mind, boost my mood, 
     and maintain physical wellness.
    
    Together, these hobbies shape my personality—disciplined,
     enthusiastic, reflective, and always striving for growth</pre>

  <pre> Also ,
    I like creating a cool design project</pre>
